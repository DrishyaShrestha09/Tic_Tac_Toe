# Tic-Tac-Toe Game with Tailwind CSS

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, automatically checking for a win or draw after each move. The game is interactive and resets after each round. It's designed for beginners or anyone interested in learning more about React and Tailwind CSS through a fun, hands-on project.
